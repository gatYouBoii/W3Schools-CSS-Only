# W3Schools-CSS-OnlyThis Folder Contains the CSS codes for most of the beginners in css. The templates are taken from the famous website w3schools.com and other sites as well. The folder will be containing the CSS codes embeded in pure css , as no other framework is used. The W3.CSS might not be your choice at this time. This folder helps you to learn the css without hesitating to code in pure css. Try to work on the designing and structure and there is always a text file for your reference.

We would love to get recommendations on the codes and logic , so that we can improve our web tempates codes. Thanks :) Keep Coding...
